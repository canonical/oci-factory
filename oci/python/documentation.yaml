  Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its
  design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
  significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and
  garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
  including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

  This image is a chiselled Ubuntu rock that contains only the Python
  runtime and its standard libraries. It is production-ready and can
  also be used as a base if additional application dependencies are
  needed.
