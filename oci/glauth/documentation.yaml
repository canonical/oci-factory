  Go-lang LDAP Authentication (GLAuth) is a secure, easy-to-use, LDAP server w/ configurable 
  backends. Use it to centralize account management across your Linux servers, your OSX machines,
  and your support applications (Jenkins, Apache/Nginx, Graylog2, and many more!).
  * Centrally manage accounts across your infrastructure
  * Centrally manage SSH keys, Linux accounts, and passwords for cloud servers.
  * Lightweight alternative to OpenLDAP and Active Directory for development, or a homelab.
  * Store your user directory in a file, local or in S3; SQL database; or proxy to existing LDAP servers.
  * Two Factor Authentication (transparent to applications)
  * Multiple backends can be chained to inject features
