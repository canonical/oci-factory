  # About Apache ZooKeeper
  ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, 
  naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. 
  All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by 
  distributed applications. Read more on the Apache website. This image is 
  shipped in support of the Apache Kafka image.
  
  Please note that the images tagged up to 3.1 are Dockerfile-base images,
  whereas from version 3.8.2 onward the images are now ROCKs. As such the
  entrypoint is now Pebble. Read more on the
  [Rockcraft docs](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/rocks/).
