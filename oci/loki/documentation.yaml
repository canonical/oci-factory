# --- OVERVIEW INFORMATION ---
application: loki
description: >
  Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log
  aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost
  effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs,
  but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

  Please note that the images tagged up to 2.4 are Dockerfile-base images,
  whereas from version 2.8.4 onward the images are now rocks. As such the
  entrypoint is now Pebble. Read more on the
  [Rockcraft docs](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/rocks/).
