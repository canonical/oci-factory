    Rust is a modern memory-safe systems programming language focused on
    performance and reliability.

    This image is a chiselled Ubuntu rock. It contains a minimal Rust toolchain
    and the Cargo build system which can be used to build a wide variety of Rust
    applications. It also includes a minimal GCC toolchain to custom build
    steps in Cargo builds.
    
    Any additional dependencies can be either mounted at runtime or installed
    with the apt installation included in this rock.

    ```

    To mount a directory with your Rust project and build it with Cargo:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm \
      -v /path/to/your/rust/project:/work \
      --workdir /work \
      ubuntu/rust:1.75-24.04_edge exec \
      cargo build --release
    ```
