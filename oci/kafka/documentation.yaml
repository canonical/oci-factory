  # About Apache Kafka
  Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform for
  high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics and integrations.
  Read more on the [Apache Kafka website](https://kafka.apache.org/).
  This image requires the
  [Apache Zookeeper image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ubuntu/zookeeper)
  to run properly.
  
  Please note that the images tagged up to 3.1 are Dockerfile-base images,
  whereas from version 3.6.1 onward the images are now rocks. As such the
  entrypoint is now Pebble. Read more on the
  [Rockcraft docs](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/rocks/).

  # Quickstart
  To deploy a single-broker dockerized version of Kafka, you need to first 
  deploy the ZooKeeper service and make sure that the ZooKeeper service is 
  reachable by Kafka. 
  
  First, create a network 
  
  ```bash 
  docker network create -d bridge kafka-network
  ```
  
  Deploy the ZooKeeper service
  
  ```bash 
  docker run --detach  --name zookeeper --network kafka-network ubuntu/zookeeper:3.8-22.04_edge
  ```
  
  Finally, deploy the Kafka service
  
  ```
  docker run --detach --name kafka --network kafka-network -p 9092:9092 ubuntu/kafka:3.6-22.04_edge
  ```
