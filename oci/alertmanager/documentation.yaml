# --- OVERVIEW INFORMATION ---
application: alertmanager
description: >
  The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the
  Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them
  to the correct receiver integrations such as email, PagerDuty, OpSGenie, or
  many other mechanisms thanks to the webhook receiver. It also takes care of
  silencing and inhibition of alerts.
