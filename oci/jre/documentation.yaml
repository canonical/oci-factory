  This image packs the Java Runtime Environment, coming
  from the [OpenJDK project](https://www.openjdk.org/), a free and open
  source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE).
  OpenJDK is the official reference implementation of Java SE since
  version 7. [Read more](https://openjdk.org/).
  Java is a registered trademark of Oracle and/or its affiliates.

  ## About Chiselled Ubuntu

  This image does not include bash nor a package manager nor the OpenJDK.
  Its purpose is to serve as a runtime, final-stage base image for
  compatible Java applications.

  Read more about chiselled Ubuntu for OpenJDK JRE, a new class of OCI images,
  on [the Ubuntu blog](https://ubuntu.com/blog/combining-distroless-and-ubuntu-chiselled-containers).
  And remember, the best base image is FROM scratch: so you could also
  [easily craft your own chiselled Ubuntu base](https://ubuntu.com/blog/craft-custom-chiselled-ubuntu-distroless)
  for your app specific needs.

  Please note that the Ubuntu 22.04 JRE images are Dockerfile-base
  images, whereas from Ubuntu 24.04 onward the images
  are now rocks. As such the entrypoint is now Pebble. Read more on the
  [Rockcraft docs](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/rocks/).

  Ubuntu 22.04 JRE images have `java` as the entrypoint.

  ```bash
  $ docker run --rm ubuntu/jre:17_edge
  Usage: java [options] <mainclass> [args...]
  ```

  Ubuntu 24.04 JRE images have `pebble enter`
  as the entrypoint. You can access the `java` with the following
  command:

  ```bash
  $ docker run --rm ubuntu/jre:21_edge exec java
  Usage: java [options] <mainclass> [args...]
  ...
  ```

    Launch this image locally:

    For Ubuntu 22.04 JRE

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name jre-container -e TZ=UTC ubuntu/jre:17-22.04_edge
    ```
    For Ubuntu 24.04 JRE

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name jre-container -e TZ=UTC ubuntu/jre:21-24.04_edge exec java
    ```

    The container logs will simply show the OpenJRE help message.
    This is because the container expects a compiled Java application to be given.

    Let's use the following Hello World application as an example:

    ```java
    // HelloWorld.java

    class HelloWorld
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            System.out.println("Hello, World");
        }
    }
    ```

    You can build and package the above Hello World application with
    chiselled Ubuntu 22.04 JRE 8 and 17 using the following example
    Dockerfile.

    ```docker
    FROM ubuntu:22.04 AS builder
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk
    WORKDIR /app
    ADD HelloWorld.java .

    RUN javac -source 8 -target 8 HelloWorld.java -d .

    FROM ubuntu/jre:8-22.04_edge

    WORKDIR /
    COPY --from=builder /app/HelloWorld.class .

    CMD [ "HelloWorld" ]
    ```

    For Ubuntu 24.04 please use

    ```docker
    FROM ubuntu:24.04 AS builder
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk
    WORKDIR /app
    ADD HelloWorld.java .

    RUN javac -source 8 -target 8 HelloWorld.java -d .

    FROM ubuntu/jre:21-24.04_edge

    COPY --from=builder /app/HelloWorld.class .

    CMD [ "exec", "java", "-cp", "/", "HelloWorld" ]
    ```

    ### Debugging

    To debug the container:

    ```bash
    docker logs -f openjdk-jre-container
    ```

    For Ubuntu 24.04 JRE, to inspect application logs:

    ```bash
    docker exec openjdk-jre-container pebble logs
    ```
