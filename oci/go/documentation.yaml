  Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

  This contains a minimal Go toolchain which can be used to build a wide variety of Go applications.
  It also includes a minimal GCC toolchain to build the Go applications that have C dependencies.

  Any additional dependencies can be either mounted at runtime or installed with the apt installation included in this rock.
