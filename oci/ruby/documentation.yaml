  Ruby is a general-purpose programming language. It is interpreted, high-level,
  and dynamically typed. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
  procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
  
  This chiseled Ruby rock contains only the core Ruby runtime, with the essential
  dependencies to run simple Ruby applications. This rock should also be used as
  a base if additional Ruby gems are needed.
