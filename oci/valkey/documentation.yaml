  This is an OCI image that bundles Valkey together with the metrics exporter.
  Valkey is an open source, flexible distributed key-value datastore that is
  optimized for caching and other realtime workloads.

  # Quickstart:

  To deploy a simple Valkey container:
  ```bash
  docker run --name valkey ubuntu/valkey:7.2.7-24.04
  ```

  To connect to Valkey and check status:
  ```bash
  docker exec valkey valkey-cli ping
  ```

  To adjust the configuration of your Valkey container (e.g. disabling protected mode), create a config file and mount it into the container to this directory:
  ```
  /var/lib/valkey
  ```
