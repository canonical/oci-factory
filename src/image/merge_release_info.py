"""
A pre-release is an informative data model meant to flag that there is
a new revision of an image that has been requested to be released.
This mechanism is necessary since one cannot know the revision number
of an image that has not yet been built. Thus, upon inferring the new
revision number and build said new image, the CI creates a pre-release
with the necessary information for the following jobs to be able to know
which revision number to release where.

NOTE: this is only necessary because the builds happen in parallel in a
GH matrix, which makes it difficult to sync and exchange information
between build. Thus pre-release data files are created for post-build
analysis.
