  # If the efficiency is measured below X%, mark as failed.

  # If the amount of wasted space makes up for X% or more of the image, mark as failed.
  # Note: the base image layer is NOT included in the total image size.
  # Expressed as a ratio between 0-1; fails if the threshold is met or crossed.
  # NOTE: this rule can be quite aggressive when the new bytes added
  # are very small (example: the hello package is small but it will
  # incur in wasteful changes in the /var/cache and /var/log, thus
  # triggering an error in Dive)
