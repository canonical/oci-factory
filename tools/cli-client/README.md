# The OCI Factory CLI Client

A CLI client that triggers GitHub workflows for building, uploading and releasing images in 
[OCI Factory](https://github.com/canonical/oci-factory).

## How to use

### New User

See ["How to Contribute as a Maintainer"](https://github.com/canonical/oci-factory?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-maintainer--).

Upon finishing the onboarding, the user should receive a GitHub Personal Access Token. This token grants you proper
permissions to trigger the build, upload and release of your rocks. This token should never be shared with 
third-parties, nor put anywhere that is publicly available.

The user will be asked to input the GitHub Personal Access Token upon triggering a workflow. For a non-interactive
terminal, it is possible to assign the token to the environmental variable `export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your token>`, and pass
`-y` to confirm the triggering by default.

### Install using Snap

sudo snap install oci-factory
